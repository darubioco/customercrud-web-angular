# customercrud-web-angular
Angular web application to create-read-update-delete customers by using RESTful web services

## Instructions
> This web app consumes RESTful web services whose source is at https://github.com/darubioco/customercrud-api-express-mongoose. You can find the instructions to deploy the services in the README file of the linked repository. If there are no services available, the web app will work, but an error will appear every time you try to connect to the API.

Run these commands:
```
npm install
npm start
```
Then open your browser at http://localhost:4200
